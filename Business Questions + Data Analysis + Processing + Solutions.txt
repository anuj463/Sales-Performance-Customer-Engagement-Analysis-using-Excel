Solution of 1st business question-
I used the concept of pivot tables to know the product category having 
the highest customer engagement.

Solution of 2nd business question-
Yes there is a relationship between discount percentage and product 
ratings. This relationship can be visualized using scatter chart where along
X-axis discount percentage is plotted and along Y-axis rating is plotted.
This helps us to understand the relationship in a clearer way.

Solution of 3rd business question-
Firstly I created a Value_For_Money column and applied the formula 
=Rating/discounted price
Then I sorted whole table by considering Value_For_Money as a parameter to
sort in Largest to smallest order.
So from the Table the first 10 products provide best value for money.

Solution of 4th business question-
I used a scatter plot with price on the X-axis and rating on the Y-axis to analyze their relationship.
The plot shows a wide spread of ratings across all price ranges, indicating no strong correlation.
This suggests that higher price does not guarantee better customer reviews.

Solution of 5th business question-
The question requires aggregating multiple metrics like average rating and sales volume at the category level, 
a pivot table is the most efficient and accurate way to summarize and compare grouped data.
 
Step 1: Keep ALL categories above average rating

Do not eliminate them yet.

You now have a shortlist of good categories.

Step 2: Apply the second condition — LOW sales volume

Now look at Total Sales for only those high-rating categories.

You have two clean, interview-safe ways to do this:

Method 1 
Define LOW sales as:

Below average Total Sales

How:

Calculate or visually estimate the average of Total Sales

Among the high-rating categories:

Keep only those below this average

Remaining categories = Hidden Opportunities
