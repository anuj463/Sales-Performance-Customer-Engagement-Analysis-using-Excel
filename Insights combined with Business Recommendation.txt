1.The value_for_money column came into existence because there was a need 
to find the products that gave value for the money spent by the customers.The 
Company should decrease the actual price of the product to reach more 
customers thereby increasing the sales.

2.The common perception that the higher-priced products should recieve 
better reviews has been changed because from the scatter chart plotted by
me I understand that even the lower-priced products can recieve better reviews.
Better reviews depends on the quality of the products so,the company should
focus on developing high quality products with reasonable price.
